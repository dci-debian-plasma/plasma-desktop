plasma-desktop (4:5.0.0a-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=medium

  [ Scarlett Clark ]
  * New upstream tarball
  * Add missing files to install

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * plasma-desktop depends breeze instead of breeze-cursor-theme as breeze
    provides the core UI styling for all of the shell
    + Drop oxygen-icon-theme as dependency as breeze packaging handles
      the oxygen relationship
    + Drop gdb-minimal | gdb; it is a dep of workspace as that is where drkonqi
      lives
    + Depend on kded5 for the kded, style, keyboard and keys kcm as well as
      the ktouchpadenabler kded module
    + Add all workspace packages as recommends or depends of plasma-desktop 
      as the entire bunch comprises what is considered a plasma-desktop.
      + Depends:
        - breeze - core theme package. needed by various parts of the stack, so
                   removing it is almost never possible or viable
        - kde-cli-tools - core tools like kcmshell5, used to run kcms
        - oxygen-sounds - applications directly reference oxygen sound names and
                          as such not having this package will render no sounds
      + Recommends:
        - kde-style-oxygen-qt5 - not needed if another style is installed
        - khelpcenter
        - khotkeys - advanced hotkey management
        - kinfocenter - information center
        - kio-extras - extra slaves, mostly useful for preview generator
        - kmenuedit
        - kwin - not needed if another wm is installed
        - kwin-decoration-oxygen - not needed if another decoration is installed
        - kwrited
        - plasma-nm
        - powerdevil
        - systemsettings
        - tty-oxygen-font-family
     + Properly resolve qml module dependencies of plasma-desktop:
       + plasma-framework (already present)
       + qtdeclarative5-kf5declarative (kquickcontrolsaddons, kcoreaddons etc.)
       + qml-module-org-kde-solid
       + kactivities (for activities)
